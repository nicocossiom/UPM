## Proposals

Proposals for *Greedy* problems:

https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/

https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/

## Notes on the proposals

Two first problems should be fairly easy, at least, the first one is quite straightforward.

Keep in mind that:

* Greedy algorithms will need to apply a sorting algorithm, 
just because you need the *best* option each time, that is, 
you need to sort your options.

* Sorting could be quite complicated. For example, in the 
"largest number" problem, the order criterion is not trivial...
Try to find it out, but mind that the solution is already 
published for everyone. So, you could read (a part of) the
solution in order to get a hint.
